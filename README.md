# Privacy-Preserving Attribution

_A [Proposal](https://patcg.github.io/charter.html#proposals)
for the [Private Advertising Technology Community^WWorking Group](https://patcg.github.io/)._

Attribution is the name given to the measurement system used in advertising.
It is called attribution because it seeks to attribute value from
an outcome (like someone buying stuff)
to advertisements.

This repository contains [a specification](https://w3c.github.io/ppa/)
that describes an API that would be presented by a browser to websites.

The specification contains all of the details.  There is no explainer.
All the explanation can be found up front, before it gets into the gory details.
